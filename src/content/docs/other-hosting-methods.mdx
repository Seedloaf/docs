title: Other Hosting Methods
description: Minecraft is a game that is significantly more enjoyable when played with friends. Unfortunately, unless you're all in the same house on a LAN connection, you'll need a server to make that happen. In this guide, I'll break down different hosting options so you can find the best to enjoy the game with your friends.

## 1. Free Hosts

If you're just looking for a quick and free way to play with friends, 
services like Seedloaf and Aternos are your best options. These platforms 
let you start a server in minutes, making them perfect for casual play 
with a small group of friends. You don't need to worry about complex setup 
steps. Plus, they support basic modding and plugins, allowing you to 
customize your world without much hassle.

### How do free hosters make money?

The typical free hoster makes money from running ads on the website, 
donations from gracious users, or by giving its users a paid plan.
As always, the free tier that you receive for signing up won't always 
have the best performance.

### Pros:

- Casual gaming sessions with a small group of friends
- People who don't need a server running 24/7
- Players who don't need lots of mods or plugins

### Cons:
- Limitations on server resources
- Servers can have wait times or a wait list

## 2. Paid Hosts:

If your need is a server with performance and customization better
than the one given free, paid hosting is the way to go. Providers
like Ember Host and BisectHosting offer stable servers with dedicated
resources, making them perfect for modded worlds or large communities.

### Why should I go for a paid server?

There are tons of ways why you should head to a paid hoster. Users 
who swap over to a paid host usually want more server resources, 
more control over their server, have their server online 24/7,
and many other reasons.

### How much do paid hosters cost?

The price can vary for each hoster. Some can have great specs, but 
have a higher price tag, while another one can have the same amount 
of specs but for a lower price.

The way they can achieve this is by changing what type of specs the 
server has.For example, a more expensive server can have faster RAM, 
while the other one can be a bit slower to save on money.

### Pros:

- Large groups or public servers that need to stay online 24/7
- Modded servers like RLCraft that require more RAM than vanilla MC
- Players who don't want to deal with the hassle of self-hosting

### Cons:

- An expense every month (varies by server resources)
- Less flexibility compared to self-hosted solutions

## 3. Renting a VPS

This is for the nerds who want absolute control over their Minecraft server,
and it gives the most value for money. Renting a Virtual Private Server
(VPS) or a dedicated server from third-party providers is a solid option.
This lets you customize literally everything and ensure consistent performance.

### How VPS Works:

If you're choosing to self-host you probably already know all of this,
but it is worth mentioning anyway

- Rent a VPS with your preferred operating system, usually Linux and a distribution such as Ubuntu
- Manually install and configure your Minecraft server. The [itzg/minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) is a great
starting point if you are using docker <span className='text-primary'>(recommended)</span>
- You have full control over performance, mods, security, backups, and more

### Why Choose a VPS?

- Full customization — No limits on plugins, mods, or settings
- Better long-term value — often cheaper than high-tier paid hosting
- Can run multiple servers — If you want a network of servers, a VPS can handle it

### Best For:

- Players are comfortable with Linux and server administration.
- Server owners who want custom mods, multiple worlds, or special configurations.
- Developers who need scalability and flexibility.

In the end, choosing the right Minecraft hosting solution is all about
finding what suits your needs best. If you want free hosting, Seedloaf
and Aternos are great options, though they do have their limitations.
If you're willing to spend a few bucks, hosts like [Ember Host](https://billing.ember.host/aff.php?aff=19)
(that's a referral link, but they really are the best paid host) and
BisectHosting are excellent choices. If you want full control over your
server or just love tinkering with technology, a VPS or dedicated
server is your best bet!
