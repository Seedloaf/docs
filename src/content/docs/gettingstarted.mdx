## Overview

Authentication is a crucial aspect of any web application, ensuring that users are who they claim to be before granting access to resources or sensitive information. Access Shield simplifies the process of user authentication, offering features such as:

- **User Registration and Login**: Allow users to create accounts and securely log in to your application.
- **Password Hashing and Encryption**: Safeguard user passwords by securely hashing and encrypting them before storage.
- **Session Management**: Manage user sessions to maintain authentication state across requests.
- **OAuth Integration**: Simplify user authentication by integrating with popular OAuth providers.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enhance security by requiring an additional authentication factor.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles and permissions to control access to resources.
