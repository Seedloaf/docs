## Grabbing your secondary address

First of all, go to your server's "Dashboard" tab on the Seedloaf website, and copy your **secondary** domain. It should look like **"nsXYZXYZ.seedloaf.com"**, where 'X', 'Y', and 'Z' are numbers.

## Setting up DNS records
You then want to use something like **Cloudflare** (which I will use in this guide, but really any DNS host will work) to manage your DNS records. Following that, create a single **"AAAA"** record (at your preferred location address) and point it to your secondary Seedloaf domain we grabbed before in step 1.

After doing so, your setup should look like the screenshot attached below.
