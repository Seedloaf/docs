## Grabbing your address

If you want to change the address Bedrock players connect at, you will need to use your server **secondary address**; otherwise, to just modify where Java players connect at, use the **primary address**.

First of all, go to your server's "Dashboard" tab on the Seedloaf website, and copy your **primary/secondary** adress. It should look like **"nsXYZXYZ.seedloaf.com"** or **example.sdlf.fun**, where 'X', 'Y', and 'Z' are numbers.

## Setting up DNS Records

After choosing your own domain, you’ll need to register it with a DNS host.
Next, use a service like **Cloudflare** (which I’ll use in this guide though any DNS host will work) to manage your DNS records.
Once set up, create a single **“AAAA”** record (at your preferred location or address) and point it to the Seedloaf domain you obtained earlier in Step 1.

After doing so, your setup should look like the screenshot attached below.
