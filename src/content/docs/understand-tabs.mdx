You may be overwhelmed with the amount of tabs Seedloaf has offered. Do not panic, as this will guide you through each tab and their main function.

### Dashboard
This is where you can see your server's performance, which includes CPU speeds, RAM usage, and storage consumption. Below that will give you access to your server's console. You can type Minecraft commands inside as if you were OP'ed on a server.

### World Settings
These options were given to you when creating your server, as you are allowed to change your server's settings at anytime. This also give you the option to remove your server if you'd like.

### Server Properties
This gives you the control on how your server operates, which includes the game's difficulty, default gamemode, maximum amount of players, server description, and many others. This also allows you to dowload experimental builds of your loader and disable the online authentication, aka cracked mode.

### Player Settings
You can add users into a whitelist, which automatically enables Whitelist mode on your server. This also allows you to add default OP users, which means after a server restart, all OP users are kept.

### Worlds & Backups
This allows you to upload custom worlds and download backups at anytime. Note that uploading custom worlds will overwrite the original world file that was already in Seedloaf.

### File Manager
This is the most advanced Seedloaf feature, this allows users to see what files your server has and upload their own custom files, which will most likely will be mods/plugins, to their server directly.

### World Logs
After a server shutdown, your console logs will get saved here for next time if your server runs into an error.

### Additional Ports
This allows users to add plugins that do different things that aren't typically ran on the server, like enabling a Geyser--bedrock crossplay--server or powering SimpleVoiceChat.

### Access Management
You can add users to your Seedloaf server to help manage it. You can invite Admins, Member, or Starter. These people must have a Seedloaf account in order to accept and receive the invitation.
