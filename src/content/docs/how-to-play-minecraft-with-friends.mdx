title: How do I play minecraft with friends?
description: Minecraft is a game that is significantly more enjoyable when played with friends. Unfortunately, unless you're all in the same house on a LAN connection, you'll need a server to make that happen. In this guide, I'll break down different hosting options so you can find the best to enjoy the game with your friends.

## 1. Free Hosts

If you're just looking for a quick and free way to play with friends,
services like Seedloaf and Aternos are your best options. These platforms
let you start a server in minutes, making them perfect for casual play
with a small group of friends. You don't need to worry about complex setup
steps. Plus, they support basic modding and plugins, allowing you to
customize your world without much hassle.

### How It Works:

1. You sign up on their website and create a server.
1. Servers only run when you start them and automatically shut down after inactivity to save resources.
1. You'll get an IP address to share with friends so they can join your world (e.g., l33tserver.sdlf.fun).

### How They Make Money:

Free hosting services survive on ads, donations, and premium plans.
While the basic service is usually free, you can pay for perks like
faster server startup, more server specs, or extra options and
regions to choose from.

### Best For:

- Casual gaming sessions with a small group of friends
- People who don't need a server running 24/7
- Players who don't need lots of mods or plugins

### Downsides:
- Some limits on performance and customizations are inevitable
- Servers might have some wait times

## 2. Paid Hosts:

If your need is a server with performance and customization better
than the one given free, paid hosting is the way to go. Providers
like Ember Host and BisectHosting offer stable servers with dedicated
resources, making them perfect for modded worlds or large communities.

### Why Paid Hosting?

1. Significantly better performance
1. More control
1. 24/7 uptime.
1. Better customer support

### Pricing:

Most paid Minecraft servers cost $5 to $10 per month for a basic setup,
but this can increase if you need more power or features.

### Best For:

- Large groups or public servers that need to stay online 24/7
- Modded servers like RLCraft that require more RAM than vanilla MC
- Players who don't want to deal with the hassle of self-hosting

### Downsides:

- Monthly cost (though not too expensive)
- Less flexibility compared to self-hosted solutions

## 3. Renting a VPS: Full Control for Advanced Users

This is for the nerds who want absolute control over their Minecraft server,
and it gives the most value for money. Renting a Virtual Private Server
(VPS) or a dedicated server from third-party providers is a solid option.
This lets you customize literally everything and ensure consistent performance.

### How It Works:

If you're choosing to self-host you probably already know all of this,
but it is worth mentioning anyway

- Rent a VPS with your preferred operating system, usually Linux and a distribution such as Ubuntu
- Manually install and configure your Minecraft server. The [itzg/minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) is a great
starting point if you are using docker <span className='text-primary'>(recommended)</span>
- You have full control over performance, mods, security, backups, and more

### Why Choose a VPS?

- Full customization â€” No limits on plugins, mods, or settings
- Better long-term value â€” often cheaper than high-tier paid hosting
- Can run multiple servers â€” If you want a network of servers, a VPS can handle it
### Challenges:

VPS requires manual setup, so some technical knowledge is required. If something goes wrong, you'll have to manage the server yourself.

It's not a good option unless you're in need of a gigantic server, OR you're just a huge nerd (like us ðŸ¤“)

### Best For:

- Players are comfortable with Linux and server administration.
- Server owners who want custom mods, multiple worlds, or special configurations.
- Developers who need scalability and flexibility.


In the end, choosing the right Minecraft hosting solution is all about
finding what suits your needs best. If you want free hosting, Seedloaf
and Aternos are great options, though they do have their limitations.
If you're willing to spend a few bucks, hosts like [Ember Host](https://billing.ember.host/aff.php?aff=19)
(that's a referral link, but they really are the best paid host) and
BisectHosting are excellent choices. If you want full control over your
server or just love tinkering with technology, a VPS or dedicated
server is your best bet!
