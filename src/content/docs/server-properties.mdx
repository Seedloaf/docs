title: How do I update Server Properties?
description: There is a Server Properties tab and I can edit the server.properties file in the File Manager. Which one should I use and why?

When you want to update your server's properties, first take a look at the 
Server Properties tab. This tab contains the properties that we have made 
easily editable from the dashboard. Properties that are available here will
**OVERWRITE**  that same property if it was changed in your server.properties 
file in the File Manager.

For example, if your 'difficulty' is set to Hard in Server Properties, and 
is set to Normal within your server.properties file in the File Manager, when 
starting the server, your world will be set to Hard difficulty. The values in 
the Server Properties tab have overwritten the values in your server.properties 
file.

For properties that aren't yet available in the Server Properties tab, you 
can set them in the server.properties file in the File Manager without them 
being overwritten. In the future, we intend to have total parity between 
the Server Properties tab and your server's server.properties file. Until 
that point, setting the server.properties from withing Fle Manager is the 
only viable solution.
