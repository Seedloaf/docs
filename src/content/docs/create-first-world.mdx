As Seedloaf expands in its player base, a lot of them get confused over our complex site. This article will help you on your first Seedloaf server journey.

Assuming you are following the guide, you should be already logged into Seedloaf. If you aren't, head back to the [home page](https://seedloaf.com) and press the login button at the top-right of your screen. You can either use an email & password, or continue with Discord.

You should see your World Overview screen, or also known as the account dashboard. There are no worlds right now as you have just created your account.

To create your very own world, click the "Create World" button that appears under the no worlds text. You will be given the option to change how people view / connect to your server.

### World Name
This is how you will view your server on the account dashboard. No one else will see this other than invited players and you.

### Subdomain
This is how players will connect and play on your world. *Seedloaf developers and moderators can view your subdomain. Do not input any text that is rule-breaking.*

### Server Type
This is the loader you server will run, with the options being Vanilla, Paper, Fabric, Forge, NeoForge, and Quilt.

### Server Version
This is the Minecraftr version the server will run. This will require other users to use that specific version to play on the server.

### Server Timezone
This is what your console will use when outputting timestamps in the console. This doesn't affect gameplay.

### Java Version
The specific version of Java that your server uses. It is best to use automatic unless you know what you are doing.

After you've configured all options to your liking, create your world and accept the EULA. This is required to run your Minecraft server.

Congratulations! You've just created your first ever Seedloaf server/world.
