### Step 1: Choosing the correct server

Geyser [does support Forge](https://geysermc.org/wiki/geyser/setup?platform=modded-servers&host=provider),
but it is generally recommended you use Paper/Spigot when running a Geyser server. The remainder of this
guide will be shown using a Paper server on Seedloaf.

### Step 2: Download the plugins

There are generally 3 plugins you should install:

1. The Geyser plugin itself - this is what actually allows Bedrock players to connect.
1. Floodgate - this allows Bedrock users to connect without requiring a Java Edition account.
1. *(Optional)* ViaVersion - this allows clients with newer versions to connect to your server.
While this is optional, it is *highly* recommended.

To download Geyser and Floodgate, [visit this page](https://geysermc.org/download)
and download the correct versions.

To download ViaVersion, [visit this page](https://viaversion.com/) and select "ViaVersion"

### Step 3: Exposing the correct port

On your Seedloaf Dashboard, click on Manage World and then go to the "Additional Ports" tab.

Once there expose port 19132. Once that is saved, you should see some text saying
<code>"Port 19132 is exposed on nsXYZ.seedloaf.com:YOUR_PORT"</code>. To connect with Bedrock
you use that address and port!
