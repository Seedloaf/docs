### Step 1: Choosing the correct server

Geyser [does support Forge](https://geysermc.org/wiki/geyser/setup?platform=modded-servers&host=provider),
but it is generally recommended you use Paper/Spigot when running a Geyser server. The remainder of this
guide will be shown using a Paper server on Seedloaf.

### Step 2: Download the plugins

There are generally 3 plugins you should install:

1. The Geyser plugin itself - this is what actually allows Bedrock players to connect.
1. Floodgate - this allows Bedrock users to connect without requiring a Java Edition account.
1. ViaVersion - this allows clients with newer versions to connect to your server.

To download Geyser and Floodgate, [visit this page](https://geysermc.org/download)
and download the correct versions.<br>
To download ViaVersion, [visit this page](https://viaversion.com/) and select "ViaVersion"

Once you have downloaded the plugins, upload them to the "plugins" file on your dashboard.

### Step 3: Configuring the plugin and server
Before continuing, you will need to start your server again so the right files can be created!

1. Find geyser's <code>config.yml</code> and change "auth-type" to <code>"floodgate"</code> - This allows bedrock players to join properly.
1. Next, find your <code>server.properties</code> file and change "enforce-secure-profile" to <code>false</code>

Save your changes and start your server for the edits to come into effect.

### Step 4: Exposing the correct port

On your Seedloaf Dashboard, click on Manage World and then go to the "Additional Ports" tab.

Once there expose port 19132. Once that is saved, you should see some text saying
<code>"Port 19132 is exposed on nsXYZ.seedloaf.com:YOUR_PORT"</code>. To connect with Bedrock
you use that address and port!

### Step 5: Have fun

Your server should now be ready to accept Bedrock players - enjoy!
