title: How do we make money?
description: If you're anything like us, you're probably a bit suspicious when something seems too good to be true. So what's our catch?

We don't make money, Seedloaf runs at a small loss every month.
That said, we do have some income streams. Our primary source income
is from advertising and affiliates. Everytime somebody upgrades to [Ember
Host](https://billing.ember.host/aff.php?aff=19) or downloads [Opera
GX](https://seedloaf.com/partner?n=ogx&s=web) we get a small commission.
The other obvious source of income is from Display Ads on the website.
You might notice we have significantly fewer ads than other
platforms - that's intentional. We prioritize your experience over
squeezing every penny out of ad revenue.

Finally, the most direct way to support a couple of nerds building something cool, is
[buying us a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/seedloaf). But there is absolutely no pressure!
