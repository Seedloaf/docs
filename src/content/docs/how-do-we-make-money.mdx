title: How we make money
description: If you're anything like us, you're probably a bit suspicious when something seems too good to be true. So what's our catch?

Seedloaf earns money from Seedloaf Premium subscriptions and from commisions.
Everytime somebody upgrades to [EmberHost](https://billing.ember.host/aff.php?aff=19)
or downloads [OperaGX](https://seedloaf.com/partner?n=ogx&s=web) 
we get a small commission. The other obvious source of income is from display ads on the website.
You might notice we have significantly fewer ads than other
platforms - that's intentional. We prioritize your experience over
squeezing every penny out of ad revenue.

Finally, the most direct way to support a couple of nerds building something cool, is
[buying us a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/seedloaf). But there is absolutely no pressure!
