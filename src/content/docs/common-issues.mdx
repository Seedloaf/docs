- **Upload custom world doesn't work** <br />
The most common issue when uploading a custom world is that **the custom 
world may have a modified name**. To fix this, update the level-name property 
inside server.properties in File Manager to be the correct name (instead of the 
default 'world').

- **My Server doesn't start after installing mods**<br />
There are two major causes for this:<br />
    1. **Mod incompatibilities:**<br />
    Each version of Minecraft has specific code structures and APIs. A mod built for one version may 
    not work on another. Even if a *single* mod is made for a different version than what your server 
    is running, it may prevent the **entire** server from starting.<br /> 
    **To fix this:** double check that all mod's versions match the exact version of minecraft your server 
    is running and that they are meant to work with the same mod loader.<br />
    1. **Missing dependencies**<br />
    Certain mods depend on other specific mods or libraries to function and Missing Dependencies errors 
    occur when those supporting files havenâ€™t been installed on your server. 
    **To fix this:** Check your logs in World Logs after a crash. It will say something along the lines of 
    *missing dependencies* with the name of the missing dependency.

    If you're unable to pinpoint the cause you can try research your error online, post it to an AI chatbot, 
    or you can create a ticket on [our Discord](https://seedloaf.com/discord).
