Seedloaf is a free Minecraft server hosting platform ran by Jasper and Theo,
a team of two software engineers and general nerds. It initially started
as a passion project of Jasper's. He was interested to see if he could leverage
a lifelong interest in technology to create a platform for anyone to enjoy
Minecraft with their friends, for free.

It turned out, he could. And as the platform has grown, he brought his
friend Theo aboard to help execute on a growing vision of what Seedloaf can be.

We want to give people freedom to engage with Minecraft in any way they
choose. If you simply want to play the latest version of vanilla Minecraft,
you can set a server up on Seedloaf in a couple of clicks. If, however, you
are interested in running a modded server, we also strive to give you the
lowest level access possible to customize your Minecraft server as you see fit.

We love what we do, and we aim to foster an interest in technology and
maintain an open dialogue with the people who use our platform. As such,
you can check out our
[Project Roadmap here](https://github.com/orgs/Seedloaf/projects/3),
and our [Seedloaf Documentation here](https://github.com/Seedloaf/docs). 
We don't use external game server management tools, the code is our own.
It means we have super fine-grained control over how Seedloaf functions,
and what we can do with the platform. We have loads of exciting new features
in the pipeline, so [join the Discord server](https://seedloaf.com/discord)
to stay up to date!

We are a small team, who maintain this project in our free time.
We have no shareholders or higher ups telling us what to do, or
steering Seedloaf in a profit-oriented direction. This allows us to
do things that other Minecraft hosting platforms can't. For example,
providing generous RAM and disk allocations for every server.

If you like what we do, take a moment to consider
[buying us a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/seedloaf). If you
aren't in a position to support us directly, it's totally fine!
You will still have access to the platform in it's entirety, due
to the generous support of others. There are still other ways you
can help, though. We run ads on Seedloaf to help offset our increasingly
expensive server costs. We'd appreciate it if you consider turning your
Adblocker extension off on our website, it helps a lot!

Finally, you can tell your friends about us. Our community is growing
every day, in large part due to all of you putting the word out.
We can't thank you enough!

We hope you enjoy!

The Seedloaf team, <br />
Jasper and Theo
