### Step 1: Finding the datapacks

First select the data packs you want installed on the server,
use a trusted site like [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/datapacks)
and pick the ones you want to install. Download the datapack and
ensure it is zipped.

### Step 2: Upload the Zip

Head over to your server's dashboard and visit the File Manager.
From the File Manager go into the world folder > datapacks folder.
From there upload the zip by dragging it onto the page. You will
be prompted to extract the zip - click "Extract".

### Step 3: Done âœ…

Once you have followed these two steps, you should have the datapack
installed on your server!

### Note:

This method does not reset the world. If your data pack generates
a custom terrain, it will merge onto your preexisting world.
This means there will be a visible border where the new terrain
starts, especially with major terrain changes (like a mountain
suddenly starting).

It is recommended to reset your world after committing major
data pack changes to ensure that all mods/items don't cause issues.
