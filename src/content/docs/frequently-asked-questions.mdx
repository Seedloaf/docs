- **How do I enable cracked mode?** <br />
When trying to connect to your server, if you see a message saying
"Failed to verify username" you likely need to disable this setting<br /><br />
On the "World Settings" page there is an Online Mode toggle.
Turn that off to allow users with cracked clients to join your server.

- **How long does the server stay online for?** <br />
The server stays online for 5 minutes after the last person disconnects.
There is also a 7 minute timer to allow the first person to connect
before the server is turned off again.

- **Why have my files been archived?** <br />
There are two reasons your files will get archived:

    1. You haven't launched your server in over a week.
    1. One of the nodes underwent maintenance and your files had to be moved.

- **How do I unarchive my files?** <br />
Visit [your dashboard](https://seedloaf.com/dashboard). Instead of seeing
"Start World" you should see an "Unarchive" button. Click
that and wait a few minutes! It shouldn't be too long.

- **How long will my server stick around?** <br />
As with pretty much all free hosts, your server will be
removed if you haven't been active for a while. <br /> <br />
After 3 weeks you will get an email warning, 1 week after
that your world will be deleted.
