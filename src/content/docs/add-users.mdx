Adding users can be a hassle in Seedloaf. Here's how you can add users to your server and choose the correct role for them.

Before this guide continues, you must request that the user you are inviting has a Seedloaf account. If they do not, they cannot receive the invite.

1. Open your [Account Dashboard](https://seedloaf.com/dashboard)
1. Press **Manage World**
1. On the sidebar, press **Access Management**

Once you are there, you are prompted to invite them with email and select a certain role to give them.

The email part is definetly staright forward, but selecting the right rule can be crucial. Here's what each role does:

### Starter
This role only allows the invited user to start the server, nothing else.

### Member
This role allows the invited user to start and stop the server. This can be useful for trusted moderators of your server.

### Admin
This role allows the invited user to do everythin that you can do, except for deleting the world.<br />
*Please keep in mind to only give this role to abosolutely trusted users.*
