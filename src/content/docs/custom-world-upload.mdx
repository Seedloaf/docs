description: A step-by-step guide on how to upload a custom Minecraft world to Seedloaf.

Start off by renaming your new world folder to `world`. Alternatively, you can change the 'level' 
property of the server in server.properties inside the **File Manager** to match the name of your 
custom world.<br />

If you intend to install datapacks on the server, you'll need to upload them to world\datapacks 
(create the folder if you don't see it). Each datapack must be in it's own folder.<br />

The easiest way to do this is this; right-click on the folder (on your computer) > *send to* > 
*compressed (zipped) folder*. You can use any other [third party zipping tool](https://7-zip.org/download.html) to do this as well. 
Once you have the zip file, go to your [Seedloaf's server dashboard](https://seedloaf.com/dashboard) > 
Manage World > World & Backups > Upload Custom World. Select the newly made zipped file and upload it. 
Give it a few minutes to upload, restart the server and you'll have a fresh new world!

Seedloaf has a maximum set amount of storage of 6GB, thus before you start uploading, ensure the world file 
is less than 6 gigabytes. If it's more than 6GB, you can use [MCA selector](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector) 
to trim off unused chunks. *Players inventories will not be affected by this change, although they will be 
teleported to the spawn point of the new world.*
